## Requirements

For building and running the application you need:

- [JDK 11](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk11-archive-downloads.html)
- [Chrome Driver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/)


## Running the application locally
Before running the application, make sure you have right version of a chrome driver. I have used version 11.
